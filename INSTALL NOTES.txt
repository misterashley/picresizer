1. Install Python3. Include Python3 in the path.
2. Install ImageMagick and include the legacy command line option during installation
3. Install Pillow.
	From Windows command line interface:
	easy_install Pillow  
	
	
	However if you didn't install the path in step 1, then you'll need to find the Python install folder.
	dir easy_install*.* /a/s may help
