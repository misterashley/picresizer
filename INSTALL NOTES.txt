1. Install Python3. Include Python3 in the path.
2. Install ImageMagick and include the legacy command line option during installation
3. Install Pillow.
	From Windows command line interface:
	
		pip install Pillow 
		(depricated: or easy_install Pillow)
	
	However if you didn't install the path in step 1, then you'll need to find the Python install folder. This may 			help find it.
		
		dir easy_install*.* /a/s
