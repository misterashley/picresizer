This is the new part. I think this will be the hardest bit.

We want to take options from the GUIgoodness so we know what we're gonna do with the files.

The big part is that we're going to take a file list from GUIgoodness.

The tricky part here is passing back some stuff to the GUI, as we're doing it. I'm happy to check in after every file, but I think the scanNplan has got to do two steps.

Scanning the files one at a time, and returning a second list with the logic we're going to ask of the werkwerkwerk module.

to get path.
from pathlib import Path
p = Path('docs')

for child in p.iterdir(): child.is_file() shows true or false.

or if child.is_file(): try getting it's dimensions.



[child for child in p.iterdir() if child.is_dir()]
